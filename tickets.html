    <h3>Diversity Tickets</h3>
    <p>We're hoping to make it easier than ever for minorities and disadvantaged groups to attend. If you'd like to donate and help us move towards that goal, that would be incredible.

    <h3>Group Tickets</h3>
    <p>If you're looking to bring a group to the conference, then we can look at giving you a discount. Please contact <a href="mailto:mike@hackference.co.uk" >Mike</a> and start the conversation. We look to give discounts on a sliding scale, so if you are buying more tickets, you'll get a bigger discount!</p>
